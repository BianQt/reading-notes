# HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
## 1. Structure
 As you know HTML is all about the structure of your web page and it is very important in helping
 readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
 and to navigate around the document.
 However, in the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly
 the same content as the Word document but in order to
 describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want
 to appear on the page.

#### So, How We Code a TextS and Features on Our Website !!
 There are several different elements. Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag and sometime its a selfclosing tag. Tags act like containers, they tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.

#### Attributes Tell Us More About Elements

## 2.  Extra Markup
here we will focus on some helpful topics that are
not easily grouped together: 
 * The different versions of HTML and how to indicate which
 version you are using 
  *  How to add comments to your code
* Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used   on
any element, including the class and id attributes
* Elements that are used to group together parts of the page where no other element is suitable
* How to embed a page within a page using iframes
* How to add information about the web page using the
< meta > element
* Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright
symbols

## 3.  HTML5 Layout
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

The point of creating these
new elements is so that web
page authors can use them to
help describe the structure of
the page. For example, screen
reader software might allow
users to ignore headers and
footers and get straight to
the content. Similarly, search
engines might place more
weight on the content in an
< article > element than that
in the < header > or < footer >
elements. I think you will agree
that it also makes the code
easier to follow.
* Headers & Footers - < header > < footer >
* Navigation - < nav >
* Articles - < article >
* Asides - < aside >
* Sections - < section >
* Heading Groups - < hgroup >
* Figures - < figure > < figcaption >
* Sectioning Elements - < div >


## 4. Process & Design
This section discusses a process that
you can use when you are creating a new
website.
* How to understand the audience your site may attract and
what information they will expect to find on it
* How to organize information so that visitors can find what
they are looking for
* Design theory for presenting information in a way that
helps visitors achieve their goals
* Design tips to help you create more attractive and
professional sites



# JavaScript

Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript
language itself, you need to become familiar with some key
concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in
three sections: 

## A. What is a script and how do I create one? 
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.  
## B. How do computers fit in with the world around them?
Computerscreate models of the world using data.
## c. How do I write a script for a web page?
JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
need any new tools to write a script.
