# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team ?!
Google — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — became focused on building the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives. Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).

The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like 
> ‘‘It’s better to put introverts together,’’ 
said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, or 
> ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’ 
But, Dubey went on, 
>‘‘it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.’’

## Why Teamwork Matters
Humans are social creatures. Civilization itself is the result of the pooled effort of innumerable people over thousands of years. Examining human collaboration can help researchers, organizations, and families determine how to maximize teamwork going forward. Raising children or keeping a clean household, for example, requires cooperation and a fair division of the workload. The same applies in almost any workplace, where good teamwork is necessary for goals to be met and customers to be satisfied.

## How to Improve Teamwork
Teamwork comes naturally to humans as a whole, but that doesn’t always mean it’s easy for individuals to work with others. Some people, particularly those who prefer to work on their own, may feel out of place in a group or get frustrated by common teamwork pitfalls. To maximize teamwork, it's important that all teammates share the same goals and are committed to an overall vision. Often it takes just one person not pulling their weight—or defying the group's goals—to derail the efforts of everyone else on the team.
