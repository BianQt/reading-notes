# *What Is Growth Mindset ?*
#### Is to believe that there always a room for change and to know that acquiring skills and knowledge is all about continuous learning, hard work and perseverance.

### For me a mindset is all about:
* Discipline.   
* Hardwork.
* Drive to Learn.
### As a reminders for me to always have a growth mindset, I have these:
1. Without it we wouldn't have an easy life, we would stuck in caves.
2. I have learned a lot of things during the year and i'm willing to keep going.
3. Always be a child how you want to try and learn every things.
