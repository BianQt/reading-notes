#  NODE.JS 
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

## npm
pm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. The package manager and the registry are managed by npm, Inc.



## Node Binaries vs Version Manager
Many websites will recommend that you head to the official Node download page and grab the Node binaries for your system. While that works, I would suggest that you use a version manager instead. This is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. There are various advantages to using a version manager. For example, it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis.

If you fancy going the version manager route, please consult our quick tip: Install Multiple Versions of Node.js using nvm. Otherwise, grab the correct binaries for your system from the link above and install those.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
![img](https://images.prismic.io/impactio-blog/06eab7d7-e9ef-4ae3-b93b-8bcc47372fb3_Pair++programming.png?auto=compress,format)
Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. Pair programming touches on all four skills that help anyone learn a new language: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
## 1. Greater efficiency
## 2. Engaged collaboration
## 3. Learning from fellow students
## 4. Social skills
## 5. Job interview readiness
## 6. Work environment readiness
