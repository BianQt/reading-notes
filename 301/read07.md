# What is REST
REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation.

Like any other architectural style, REST also does have it’s own 6 guiding constraints which must be satisfied if an interface needs to be referred as RESTful. These principles are listed below.

## Guiding Principles of REST
* **Client–server** – By separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.
###
* **Stateless** – Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.
###
* **Cacheable** – Cache constraints require that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If a response is cacheable, then a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later, equivalent requests.
###
* **Uniform interface** – By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved. In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints are needed to guide the behavior of components. 
## Resource Methods
Another important thing associated with REST is resource methods to be used to perform the desired transition. A large number of people wrongly relate resource methods to HTTP **GET/PUT/POST/DELETE** methods.

# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team ?!
Google — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — became focused on building the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives. Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).
###
The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like 
> ‘‘It’s better to put introverts together,’’ 
said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, or 
> ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’ 
But, Dubey went on, 
>‘‘it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.’’

## Why Teamwork Matters
Humans are social creatures. Civilization itself is the result of the pooled effort of innumerable people over thousands of years. Examining human collaboration can help researchers, organizations, and families determine how to maximize teamwork going forward. Raising children or keeping a clean household, for example, requires cooperation and a fair division of the workload. The same applies in almost any workplace, where good teamwork is necessary for goals to be met and customers to be satisfied.

## How to Improve Teamwork
Teamwork comes naturally to humans as a whole, but that doesn’t always mean it’s easy for individuals to work with others. Some people, particularly those who prefer to work on their own, may feel out of place in a group or get frustrated by common teamwork pitfalls. To maximize teamwork, it's important that all teammates share the same goals and are committed to an overall vision. Often it takes just one person not pulling their weight—or defying the group's goals—to derail the efforts of everyone else on the team.
