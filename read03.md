# Wireframe
  Wireframe is the prototype we initiat as starting point, you can't just start designing your web page without a sketch .Without the distractions of colors, typeface choices or text, wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface. A commonly-used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used. A button or call to action needs to be clear to the user even it’s not brightly colored and flashing.

# HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
 For example, take the following line of content:

> My cat is very grumpy 

If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:

> <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>

# Semantics
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

### Semantic elements
These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:

* <article>
* <aside>
* <details>
* <figcaption>
* <figure>
* <footer>
* <header>
* <main>
* <mark>
* <nav>
* <section>
* <summary>
* <time>
