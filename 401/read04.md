# Data Modeling

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  - Better program design and higher code quality
  - Detailed project documentation
  - TDD reduces the time required for project development

* In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
  - If we have a global middleware and we want to test the ```next```.

* What is one downside of Test Driven Development
  - Tests got to be maintained when requirements change.

* Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
  - The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.
* Why REST?
  - REST is Easy to Understand and Implement.
  - REST Makes your Application More Scalable
  - Faster Data Interchange Format

## Vocabulary Terms

* **functional programming** : is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style.


* **object-oriented programming (OOP)** : is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods)


* **class** : is a template for creating object.


* **super** : is a keyword used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods.


* **this** : The value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called.


* **Test Driven Development (TDD)** : is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. 


* **Jest** : is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.


* **Continuous Integration (CI)** : is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.


* **REST** : is an architectural style that has gained a lot of popularity in recent years due to its simplicity and scalability.


* **Data Model** : is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
