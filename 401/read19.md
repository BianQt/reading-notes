# AWS: Events

## Review, Research, and Discussion
* Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server
   - Express Gateway and Amazon API Gateway are two different products for configuring middleware servers that provide services like rate limiting, authentication, and proxying.
* List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
   - Amazon Relational Database Service or Amazon RDS is a managed cloud database service from AWS. It is a service designed to simplify the creation, operation, management, and scaling of a relational database for use as an application backend. AWS launched the RDS service initially in October 2009 with support for MySQL. As years went on, the RDS service added managed services for various other databases like SQL Server, Oracle database, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.
* Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
   - Amazon SQS provides several advantages over building your own software for managing message queues or using commercial or open-source message queuing systems that require significant up-front time for development and configuration.
* How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
  - it prepares a request with a certain attributes set and sends it to server. In the next stage server receives a request.


## Vocabulary Terms

* **Serverless API **:is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. 
* **Triggers** : is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server. 
* **Dynamo vs Mongo** : Both these databases support multi-document transactions, but with key differences: MongoDB supports read and writes to the same documents and fields in a single database transaction. DynamoDB lacks support for multiple operations within a single transaction.

* **Dynamoose vs Mongoose** : Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB (inspired by Mongoose)
