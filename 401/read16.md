# Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

  - The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).

- Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC?
  - A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.
- What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
  - is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.

## Vocabulary Terms

- **WRRC** : Request/response cycle traces how a requests flow through the app.

  ### Amazon EC2

  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.
  ###
  Amazon EC2 offers the broadest and deepest compute platform with choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model. We offer the fastest processors in the cloud and we are the only cloud with 400 Gbps ethernet networking. We have the most powerful GPU instances for machine learning training and graphics workloads, as well as the lowest cost-per-inference instances in the cloud. More SAP, HPC, Machine Learning, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud. Click here to learn What's New with Amazon EC2.
