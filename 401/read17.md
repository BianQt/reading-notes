# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion
* Describe “The Cloud”
  - The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world.
* What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
  - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

* What is auto-scaling?
  - Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.
* What is bandwidth?
  - Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time.


* How do cloud providers compute service costs?
  - When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor.


## Vocabulary Terms
* **Server Instances** : A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.

* **Containers** :  is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
* **Cloud Services** : Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. 
* **Cloud Architecture** : Cloud architecture defines the technology components that are combined to build a cloud, where resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network. 
* **AWS** : AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

* **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku** : 
  - Heroku is the ideal solution for an individual or a small team, or a small business. It makes life easier when deploying apps as it's pretty straightforward, and you need not be knowledgeable about how the infrastructure side is working. You do not need DevOps resources. Heroku is suitable for smaller cloud apps. Depending on your project, Heroku can be expensive if the app is intensive on traffic.

  - AWS is perfect for medium and large businesses. It should be chosen when one needs flexibility right from the initial application deployment. You will need DevOps resources to manage the infrastructure and involves additional costs. Setting up the desired infrastructure on AWS can take a few months as well. AWS has a stable ecosystem with services, tools, and apps for the cloud.
