## Review, Research, and Discussion

* What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.

* Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server :
1- [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock)
###
2- [MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/)
###
3- [Postman Mock Server](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)

* Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

**apiDocjs:** Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code. It includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.js and apiproject.js as a html-page; 
###
**Swagger Inspector:** Test and Document Your APIs With Ease. It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.


* Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
**SOAP** is a protocol which was designed before REST and came into the picture. The main idea behind designing SOAP was to ensure that programs built on different platforms and programming languages could exchange data in an easy manner. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.
###
**REST** was designed specifically for working with components such as media components, files, or even objects on a particular hardware device. Any web service that is defined on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service. A Restful service would use the normal HTTP verbs of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for working with the required components. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
###
Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. Hence, it’s always good to understand in which situations each design should be used. This REST and SOAP API difference tutorial will go into some of the key difference between REST and SOAP API as well as what challenges you might encounter while using them.

##  Vocabulary Terms
* **Web Server** : is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests and send responses via HTTP or its secure variant HTTPS
* **Express** : is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
* **Routing** : Routing defines the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints.
* **WRRC** : Request/response cycle traces how a requests flow through the app.
