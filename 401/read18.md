# API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion
* What are serverless functions?
  - A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.

* If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
   - Open the Functions page of the Lambda console.

   - Choose Create function.

   - Under Basic information, do the following:

       - For Function name, enter my-function.

       - For Runtime, confirm that Node.js 14.x is selected. Note that Lambda provides runtimes for .NET (PowerShell, C#), Go, Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.

   - Choose Create function.
* Describe how a CDN works
  - A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.
