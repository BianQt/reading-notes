# Component Based UI

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
    -  Angular
    -  Webix
    -  Vue
    -  Sencha
    -  Backbone.js
* Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
    - A **library** performs specific, well-defined operations.
    - A **framework** is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

## Vocabulary Terms
* **Rendering** : Rendering is the most important procedure that a programmer has to manage in frontend development. In React, the render() method is the only required method in a class component, and is responsible for describing the view to be rendered to the browser window.

* **Templates** : React templates are sets of ready-to-use parts of code built using React technology for the development of dynamic user interfaces. ... Depending on the type and amount of included elements, React templates offer various packs of code from full-fledged pages for an app to a set of customizable UI components.

* **State** : The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
