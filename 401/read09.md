# Authorization/Authentication
## Review, Research, and Discussion

* What header(s) are used in authentication and authorization
   - The Authorization request header can be used to provide credentials that authenticate a user agent with a server, allowing access to a protected resource.
- The Authorization header is usually, but not always, sent after the user agent first attempts to  request a protected resource without credentials.
* What is safe to put into a JWT
 - Public claims with public names
* How are JWTs validated
- By signature.


## Vocabulary Terms

* **RBAC** : Role-based access control is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.
* **User Roles** : is a clearly defined set of abilities, or permissions, for use within system.
* **JWT Token** :  is a JSON encoded representation of a claim(s) that can be transferred between two parties.
