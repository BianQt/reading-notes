## How to Solve Programming Problems & Think like Programmer!
Problem solving is the meta-skill. We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.
###
There are steps you should do when you encounter a new problem? 
This doesn’t mean they did everything the same way. Everyone is different. You’ll be different. But if you start with principles we all agree are good, you’ll get a lot further a lot quicker.

> “The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul

### 1. Understand 
How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

> “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman

### 2. Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!
###
“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

### 3. Divide
Do not try to solve one big problem. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer). Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem.


### 4. Stuck?

* Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
* Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
* Research: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.

### 5. Practice
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with < concept >.”


## 5 Whys
Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly.
### The model follows a very simple seven-step process:
1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures


## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

> “Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don’t have enough.” -Grant Cardone, NYT best-selling author

> “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss

It takes discipline to not become “busy.”
Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

## Event Loop 

* Basically, Javascript is a single threaded programming language which means it can run one piece of code at the time.
* Call Stack is a data structure that basically records where we are in the program.
* Async Call is a function with arguments that will start exciting the code in the background and will not stop the rest of the code from executing.
* The task of the event loop is to look at the stack and search the Stak queues. If the stack is empty, it takes the first thing in the queue and pushes it into the call stack.


## The Super Mario Effect

Super Mario effect is focusing on the princess not the pits, to stick with a task and learn more.
In other words, the focus and obsession is about beating the game not how dumb you might look if you got hit by green light. And as direct result of that attitude of learning from and not being focused on the failure, we learn a ton in very short time.
