# Trees

A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes, where each node is a data structure consisting of a value and a list of references to nodes. The start of the tree is the "root node" and the reference nodes are the "children". No reference is duplicated and none points to the root.

## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. The node at the top of the hierarchy of a tree is called the root node. The nodes that hold other sub-nodes are the parent nodes.

## Binary Search Tree
In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.
